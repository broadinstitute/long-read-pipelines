# Long read pipelines
This repository contains pipelines for processing of long read data from PacBio and/or Oxford Nanopore platforms.  The pipelines are written in [WDL 1.0](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#introduction) intended for use with Google Cloud Platform via the scientific workflow engine, [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell).  Processing is designed to be reasonably consistent between both long read platforms, and use platform-specific options or tasks where necessary.

High level workflows can be found in the wdl/ directory.
