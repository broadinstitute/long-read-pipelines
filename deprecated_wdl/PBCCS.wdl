## A workflow that performs CCS correction on PacBio HiFi reads from a single flow cell.
## The workflow shards the subreads into clusters and performs CCS in parallel on each cluster.
## Ultimately, all the corrected reads (and uncorrected) are gathered into a single BAM.
## Various metrics are produced along the way.
